# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes failing to apply correctly.  The problem is often related to the build process or configuration issues, not necessarily errors in your CSS. This example showcases the problem and its solution.

## Problem

In `bug.js`, a simple div is styled using Tailwind CSS classes. Despite using valid classes, the styles don't appear as expected.  This happens even after running the build process.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to resolve this issue.  The solution usually involves ensuring that your Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up, and that the build process correctly incorporates your Tailwind styles.  Often, double-checking your `tailwind.config.js` file and build steps is sufficient.
